# Code_Quiz_WEB_APIs 🚧

## Technology
Uses Javascript, HTML, CSS.
The coding demonstrates use of Local Browser Storage. 

### WHY 🚧
🙏 Please Note this was a simply constructed, where function defined form. Plans to improve the interface and storage and quiz formatting. So this will be considered under 🚧 with plans to really look into this after 📅 September 14th (because having a 👶 will free up time from 👨‍💼 work?? and at 🏠 home??, super 🙏)

## What is Going On
This is an exercise from Coding Bootcamp, no code to start, freedom to implement in any manner.  

### User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

### Should Achieve

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
